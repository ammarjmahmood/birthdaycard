        <h3>Dear Ninja, Hagrid, Chewbaca, Nerd... </h3>
        <p>An individual of many names, yet Ninja is probably my favorite.</p>
        <p>It describes how quiet you are, yet always suprising people like me</p>
        <p>Donkey and the badass dragon. I think that accuratly sums up our relationship</p>
        <p>Your art skills are immaculate. So amazing! You gotta tutor me</p>
        <p>I had a great time at wonderland, and you definitely were scared on the Bat ride</p>
        <p>So much I learned about you in only 15 days (16 today) but now you are 17 which is great!</p>
        <p>I cherish all the memories we have had together so far, and hope to make more</p>
        <p>Try not to miss me too much, I am only a phone call away.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p class="signed">Papa smurf</p>
